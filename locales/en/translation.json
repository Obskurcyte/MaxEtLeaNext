    "2": "The term Montesorri comes from ",
    "3": ". An Italian doctor and teacher, she studied children and their development for several years. This is how this philosophy was born. A philosophy that tries to exploit the child’s potential by developing his autonomy and helps him develop his capacities by himself. In order to do this, it is important to change the way you see him and to give him the means to be able to do things by himself. This means give him tools that are adapted to his size and his strength so that he can manipulate them, experiment and improve over time. If for example, we want to familiarise the child with the way we transfer a liquid from one container to another: we need to be sure that we are using tools that he can use in an optimal way. Using a small glass for example instead of a big vase and 50cl of water rather than a liter. In conclusion, with this method the child will be able to learn and evolve in a safe and secure environment. This environment should therefore be adapted to his age, size and strength. The child will thus be constantly learning, evolving, becoming autonomous and thus this way independent from an adult.",
    "4": "It is through his education that the child starts his social life. The goal of education is to make him independent. During the first years of his life, the child is completely dependent on his parents. But very quickly he will interact with the world around him and this is how he will start to develop. The adult will be his role model and he will try to imitate his actions and reactions. This is why, the child will quickly have to do many activities on his own just like adults do. The Montessori concept teaches you how to meet his needs and prepare him to face the world.\n",
    "5": "B",
    "6": "eing by his side while he is experimenting is also very important, because he will learn better with the help of an adult. It is good to give him space and make as he wishes for him to learn the result of his actions, then show him the “right” method and encourage him. Here “help me do it on my own” is not the same as “teach me how to do it by myself”. In fact “help him” implies guiding your child, being by his side in order to help him, whereas “teach me” refers to teaching the child to be independent from the parent. The child only receives the knowledge of the adult which does not go along with the idea of an egalitarian relationship. On the other hand, if you are by his side to guide him, the child will experience things by himself and he will make mistakes that will be useful for him all throughout his learning experience.",
    "7": "The child arrives like a blank sheet of paper to this world, in which he has to find a place. He has to learn to live alone and with others. He has to get used to this new world. In order to succeed in this long process, the child needs his parents. The parent is therefore the initiator since it is him who gives him life. Then at school, the teacher becomes a good support for him. The adult is therefore a guide all throughout the child’s learning period. But when the adult teaches the child absolute truths which he can neither verify nor contradict, then his way to autonomy disappears gradually. It is essential that the child learns by himself. This way, he will become an adult capable of learning on his own without the need to systematically resort to others for guidance. He will therefore be autonomous. But in order to do that, his adult guidance will have to incite him to play and to discover the world that surrounds him. The child will have to regulate his activities himself, set his own limits and become aware of the possibilities open to him.",
    "8": "Max & Lea’s 5 tips",
    "9": "Set the example",
    "10": "This is something we recommend often at Max & Lea whatever the subject, and it is in fact something essential. Children learn from their parents, it is important therefore to show him the way he should act and react. Always wanting to imitate the adult, he will naturally imitate all the positive actions. But he will also imitate the bad behavior that he sees. This is why setting a good example is necessary. When this is not respected by the parent (getting mad or swearing for example) It is essential to explain that it was a mistake and why this behavior is bad and it should not be imitated. Apologizing for one’s own behavior to your child is not a sign of weakness but a way to teach him to apologize himself.",
    "11": "Encouraging and Caring",
    "12": "Encouraging your child to move forward. Congratulating him regularly encourages him to try and improve. A caring behavior will help your child to try new experiences and to develop his initiative. At Max & Lea we encourage this kind of behavior. You have to let your child make his own mistakes, encourage him when he is discovering by himself and congratulate him when he succeeds on his own.",
    "13": "Trust him",
    "14": "A child will develop positively when he feels his parents trust him. Just like he can feel the doubt in your words and your actions. Trusting him, means letting him do things on his own. He needs to learn from his experiences.\n",
    "15": "Listen to his questions",
    "16": "Listen and answer! Discovering the world that surrounds him generates a lot of questions for the child and who better than the parent to help him understand. “Why is the sky blue?” or “Why is water wet?” There are many questions that are harder to answer than they seem. Not everybody has a scientific answer for all those questions. However it is important to give him an answer and above all that he feels that you are willing to help him.",
    "17": "Different experiences",
    "18": "Finally our last tip: Make him discover and experience activities so that they interact with as many elements as possible. Outdoor activities, coloring, playing etc are all fun and entertaining activities and necessary for him to develop his experience. The list of activities is endless, if you lack inspiration ask your relatives or friends or take a look on the internet."

    "2": "When you get back from an exhausting day, you can only think about relaxing with your child. But as soon as you get home, you come across: “Can we play?”\nPlaying, for a child, seems to be his main goal. But why? It was not until I received the Playboard that I really started to wonder about this aspect of child development.\n",
    "3": "When the baby is just born, he is immature, constantly developing. He is growing physiologically. It always develops uniformly: longitudinal and axial.\nIn other words, the baby grows and then stabilizes his lower limbs, culminating in walking, around 1 year of age. He then keeps refining the maturity of its limbs down to the fingers, its fine dexterity or more commonly known as skills.\nAt the same time, the brain matures, cognitive functions such as memory, language and executive functions become more and more efficient.",
    "4": "In summary, Max & Lea’s Playboard is the ideal tool to stimulate these cognitive functions. It is the perfect ally for the psychomotor development of children from 1 to 6 years old.\nThe child will be happy to be able to use his new abilities by manipulating circles, stars, stacking rings.\nAs they develop, the child will recognize animals, name them, categorize them (key step for memorization and concentration).\n",
    "5": "Playing is the best means of communication between children and adults. It is important that the child feels supported while he learns through play. Parents must be involved! Playing for children has a cognitive but also a socializing role.",
    "6": "When you have a tool like the Playboard at your disposal, it is important to be creative. When you play with your child, he will show you what he can do, he will be proud of himself, and you too! Without realizing it, the child will be building his self-esteem, which is the basis of his mental well-being.",
    "7": "You can also approach the management of emotions through the Playboard. For example, when he can’t stack the circles, or when he is not able to fit the shapes, your child may get angry. Show him that anger should not take precedence over learning. When a so-called negative emotion occurs, cognitive functions are blocked and we can no longer think.\nSo reassure your child and show him that learning is about trying, failing and succeeding! Even if he is young, the child understands, you just have to adapt your vocabulary to his age.",
    "8": "Don’t hesitate to give other uses to the Playboard! You can start introducing foreign languages with it by naming shapes, colors or animals in different languages.",
    "9": "As they develop, children learn to live in society, they learn the rules. By using the Playboard, you can introduce these concepts. It is reassuring for a child to know that they are growing up in a stable environment where there are limits. It is of course normal that the child will want to see what is beyond these limits, this is the No! Phase! … But don’t worry, this is a sign of good psychic functioning!",
    "10": "In short, you have an adaptable educational tool at your disposal, perfect to help the child’s psychomotor development. The Playboard offers you almost endless possibilities, it’s up to you to set the limits!",

Between one and three years old, the toddler starts to familiarize themselves with the numbers. He can start naming them and can recite them from 1 to 10, of course, not always in the right order. He will know that if we take 1 from 2 it will only remain one. If we add 1 to 2 we will have 3.

Whether it is for financial needs, her passion for her career or the way others look at it. There are numerous “reasons” that incite a mother to return to work. On the other hand, the desire to see her child grow up, to be beside him or her and to create special memories with him, tilts the balance the other way.

Between bringing the kids to school in the morning, the meeting with the company directors, picking up the kids in the afternoon, the teleconference with a client on Wednesday, the appointment with the orthodontist and finally taking care of your kids when they get sick, it is better to have a flexible schedule and above all to work in a company that understands your need for flexibility. Because depending on the size of the company, its sector of activity or the position that you occupy, the working hours are more or less flexible from one company to another to let you educate your children.

At Max & Lea we don’t believe in threatening but in direct communication with the child. If you tell him that it is time to go to bed and after negotiating you agree to let him 5 additional minutes, you should keep your word. After 5 minutes, the child should go to sleep and understand that you were already nice to him by giving in and letting him stay 5 more minutes. If on the contrary, the 5 minutes become 15 because the child keeps insisting, this pattern is likely to reproduce often. The same way, saying “no” to one of his requests is a strong choice. So you shouldn’t go backwards and change your mind. In case you change your mind, you have to explain to him why.",

Always try to praise him for his work. Results (grades at school for example) are not the most important factors. In fact, some children get good grades without even working, while others study a lot and don’t get good results.

Reading, being on the phone or even talking to other parents can sometimes distract you from taking care of your child. A safe environment depends on your own appreciation. This can be as simple as doors being difficult for children to open, which can give you the certainty that your child will not run to the street when you turn around.

We will explain to you the concept of a moral contract and parental example at the end of this article. For children over the age of 5, they should not spend more than 2 hours a day in front of a screen. Contrary to preconceived ideas, screens can also have some positive effects on children. ",
    "33": "But it is important to keep in mind that before the age of 2, the use of screens is not recommended and they should never replace interactions with others and traditional playing.",

    "35": "tool",
    "36": "Some existing or coming applications could be a better learning tool than television programs because of their interactivity. ",
    "37": "Children can respond to the stimuli they receive, which helps them discover new forms of interaction. They can learn for example, to recognise sounds, rhythms, characters, etc. They can also develop logic, visual skills and problem-solving abilities. ",
    "38": "However, parental guidance when they use the application is paramount, as it has been proven that children learn better when they are accompanied and guided. ",
    "39": "The 5 tips from Max & Lea: ",
    "40": "Limiting the time spent in front of screens for the whole family",
    "41": "Because an adult has to set an example, it is less effective to tell young children that they should play with toys if he sees mom and dad always in front of a screen. We know that it is difficult because nowadays we have distractions everywhere: the agenda on the phone, the emails on the tablet or the computer, the news on the television etc. We therefore recommend you to separate the screen time from the time you spent with your children, for example you could watch the news while your children are taking a nap.",
    "42": "Set screen time limits and make a moral contract",
    "43": "The introduction of screens in the life of a child has to be regulated. This is done by limiting the time during which the child will be able to use the screen and by reminding him about this limitation when you ask him to stop. That way he will be waiting for that moment and will know how long it will last. It is also convenient to talk with him about what he has learned and seen. That way getting away from the screen will be more gradual. At Max & Lea, we believe that a moral contract with the child will teach him to be responsible to manage the time he spends in front of screens. It is about setting with him how much time he should spend in front of a screen and gradually making sure that he will stop by himself later on. That will also teach the child to respect rules and have self discipline.",
    "44": "Accompany the child as much as possible",
    "45": "We will never say often enough, that a child learns better when accompanied by an adult. Even if it can be tempting to let the child alone with a tablet or application, at Max & Lea we recommend to guide the child step by step. Let them manage the time they spend using a screen themselves but always keep an eye on their evolution. Discussing about what he has just learned afterwards allows the child to memorize what he learned.",
    "46": "Using a screen should never replace social activities or interactions",
    "47": "What we mean is that if it is possible to get the child to do other activities rather than being in front of a screen, then the first option should be preferred. In other words, the screen has to be used occasionally. The fact that the child has the right to use it for 30 minutes a day does not mean that it should become a daily activity. It is always better for them to play outside or practice educational activities at home. It is the best way for your child to develop and the healthiest way too.",
    "48": "A screen should not be a reward for bad behavior",
    "49": "A lot of parents are tempted to let the child in front of a screen to calm them down when they are overexcited. That may sometimes work, but the risk is that the content of the program may irritate the child even further. The loud sounds, special effects and fast images are exposing the child to so many stimuli at the same time, that this could have the opposite effect to the one desired. Especially because the child does not learn to control or to regulate his mood by himself. Which is essential for him to learn. Unfortunately, using a screen to calm a child down has the effect of rewarding difficult behavior."

    "1": "Positive Education",
    "2": "Being a parent is not an easy job. The phrase “I had a life before I had children” sums it up perfectly. Lowering your principles without taking your child, as he is, into account, can make you grow apart from him. The job of a parent is to adapt to the child, to his desires and his needs. Absolute truths, such as “I was always told that when I was a child” or “In my days it worked that way” do not mean anything to a young child. We all have these parent friends, who have a perfect life on social media. Their kids are always smiling, always obedient and they never scream! We can assure you that this doesn’t exist in real life. Yes, all parents have to deal with their children’s crises and sometimes even their own. This can happen because of a bad day at work, after a discussion with your partner, or after repeating the same thing 20 times to your little one with no reaction. In addition to all this, we hear more and more about positive education. Is positive education the opposite of a negative education? We will answer these questions for you.",
    "3": "Positive education is also called effective parenting or positive parenting. It is an education based on listening, caring, trusting and supporting. These are all elements that will enable a young child to develop into a fulfilled, autonomous and responsible adult.",
    "4": "The origin of this educational method is based in ",
    "5": "‘s concept of “non-violent communication”. In 1970, he defined this ideology as communicating with others in a non aggressive or judgmental way. In short, positive education aims to encourage rather than punish the child in order to help him or her to be autonomous and responsible.",
    "6": "Here are the 4 principles that define positive parenting:\n",
    "7": "Positive discipline: ",
    "8": "It is based in the study of child psychology and focuses on a form of non-violent (neither physical nor verbal) discipline. It was developed by Jane Nelsen and Lynn Lott in the1970s. It consists of disciplining in a firm and kind way without resorting to yelling, punishing, threatening, blackmailing or giving rewards.",
    "9": "Proactive parenting: ",
    "10": "It requires a lot of commitment from the parents to promote the child’s development through care. It is important to fight against some of the automatisms that we have in certain situations and learn to develop new ones. Proactive parenting requires a lot of work on yourself and allows you to live in a peaceful family environment.",
    "11": "Caring education: ",
    "12": "The objective of caring education is to establish an egalitarian parent-child relationship where the needs of each one is respected. It’s the middle ground between laxity and authoritarianism.",
    "13": "Non-violent communication: ",
    "14": "It’s a powerful tool that can heal the parent-child relationship. It is based on communication through non-violent verbal or physical means so that no one feels assaulted. This is called caring communication.",
    "15": "Max & Lea’s 5 tips: ",
    "16": "Start by taking care of yourself",
    "17": "Being a parent can be exhausting. In order to be able to put certain situations into perspective and respond to them in the best way possible, it is very important that you are rested. You may think it is easier said than done and it is true. This is why you have to sleep enough and that can be done by taking naps even if it is to the detriment of the household chores. You also have to eat well, do not forget to have breakfast and limit your coffee intake if you have a tendency to become irritated when you drink coffee’. You should also oxygenate yourself as much as possible, this can be done by going for a walk in the park with your children if you have a limited time or even better making sport.",
    "18": "Avoid saying no",
    "19": "Use positive sentences: Instead of saying “do not yell”, say “please play calmly”. This may sound irrelevant, but the first sentence is a prohibition (it implies that he could be punished) while the second one invites the child to control himself, to practice self discipline. The second sentence, which is a positive sentence, will tend to be said in a calmer tone than the first one. The “please” at the end makes a whole difference and sets the basis for an egalitarian relationship. At first, you will spend some time correcting yourself, but you will quickly see the positive effects of communicating in a positive way. If you ask your child to color only in the frame provided for that purpose rather than telling him to not go over it, he will be proud to show you that he has succeeded and that he knows how to do it.",
    "20": "Set an example",
    "21": "Parents are always a role model for their children, who are always trying to imitate them. Try not to raise your voice in order to not validate this sort of behavior in front of your child. An inappropriate reaction in a stressful situation can be misinterpreted by the child. Apologizing can correct the situation and teach him to apologize when he has to. Once again, this requires a lot of work on yourself but you will not regret it.",
    "22": "Play and laugh together",
    "23": "Children learn through play and they learn even better when they are accompanied by an adult. Those moments of sharing help to create a positive relationship. Laughter has a positive influence on your brain. Laughing together allows you to share moments of happiness and therefore calm tensions. The use of an intermediary such as a plush for example can also help calm a situation or make a learning experience easier, for example: “Mr. teddy bear says that you have to brush your teeth before going to bed”.",
    "24": "Read and learn more about it",
    "25": "At Max & Lea we are convinced that the experience of some can be beneficial for others. It is even better, if the experienced person is a specialist on the subject. This is why we recommend you to read more on the subject: ",

    "2": "Not all adults are equally perceptive to music. This can be explained in part by the interaction that each individual has had with music. An adult who has been introduced to music at an early age will be more likely than another to develop a sensitivity to rhythm and melody. We know that music stimulation has many advantages. The main advantages are the stimulation of the young child’s brain and the development of his skills. In addition to this, it is a pleasure to listen to music and it helps relax.",
    "3": "Here are the main benefits of music for young children",
    "4": "Music improves your child’s learning ability :",
    "5": "Music helps develop different areas of a child’s brain and trains them to listen, memorize and pay attention. Trying to learn a song, children will use their attention by listening to the song and by trying to recognize the lyrics. He then will try to memorize it, to be able to sing it too.",
    "6": "The lyrics of the songs will enrich your child’s vocabulary :",
    "7": "The child’s vocabulary is enriched with each song he listens to. While it is true that he will not always immediately understand the meaning of it, this will come with time and with your help. When he sings, the child practices making sounds, saying words and making sentences. He then begins to understand that words are made up of syllables and this will help him learn to read and write.",
    "8": "Music promotes his creativity and improves his motor skills :",
    "9": "Once he learns the lyrics of the songs perfectly, your child will naturally try to create his own. So he will use his imagination. He will also try to make different movements while learning the song. He will swing, jump and shake up. This is how he will begin to learn to dance and that will improve his coordination. The child discovers rhythm by moving freely with the music. His creativity will develop enormously by doing this, as will his motor skills.",
    "10": "Music is an agent of socialization :",
    "11": "Knowing the lyrics of a song will allow him to sing along with his friends. Knowing the movements to follow the rhythm of a song will allow him to dance with other children. These first moments are very important for the child to learn to interact with the world around him. He will then create affinities with others which will allow him to interact socially in other ways...",
    "12": "Music has a relaxing effect :",
    "13": "Making music, singing and dancing produces hormones associated with pleasure. Music helps children manage their emotions and has a relaxing effect on the child. For example; when your child does not feel good, you can sing his favorite song. His attention will then be focused on something positive and he will pay less attention to the pain.",
    "14": "From a more scientific point of view, we know that the left side of the brain is the analytical part. This one will analyze the notes, the harmony and rhythms so that the child understands their logic. The right part of the brain is more sensible and creative, and will activate the emotions which will make him enjoy music. Recently, the School of Communication of the Northwestern University Of Chicago published a study that provided precise evidence about the neurobiological evolution of the brain in children that have been introduced to music at an early age. Nina Kraus, communication science professor says, “Our observations demonstrate that learning music can literally reshape the child’s brain in order to improve its reception of the sound, which automatically improves its learning and language skills”.

    "18": "At Max & Lea we believe in the positive effects of music on small children, that is why we believe that you should take advantage of every opportunity to introduce him to music. As a baby, it is possible to create a routine when changing diapers. You could start by humming a tune, you will teach him the lyrics and their meaning later on. You could then sing another song when storing the toys or when he goes to sleep. The important thing is to make the child want to hear a song when he goes to bed.",
    "19": "Teach them the songs that defined your childhood",
    "20": "Because there is nothing better than watching our own children entertain themselves by singing the songs that defined our childhood, we invite you to make him discover the songs that defined you as a child. Itsy bitsy spider, Old mcDonald had a farm, Twinkle Twinkle little star, Humpty Dumpty, Hickory dickory dock.",
    "21": "Use nursery rhymes with movements",
    "22": "Nursery Rhymes with movement have many virtues. In addition to introducing the child to the rhythm, it introduces him to dance and helps him discover his body parts. Children never get tired of it and they will remember their catchy lyrics as soon as they hear the first notes. If you are happy and you know it, clap your hands. Baby Shark: doo, doo, doo, doo. The wheels on the bus go round and round. There are many more, these are often children’s favorites.",
    "23": "Give preference to musical instruments",
    "24": "Many parents are tempted to introduce children to music by giving them imitations of instruments such as guitars, pianos or flutes. However, their sound is often poor quality and will quickly drive you crazy. Add to this the health problems that could be caused by the use of a wind instrument that will be in contact with his mouth and we very quickly come to the conclusion that it is better to use a real musical instrument. The tambourine is a very good example. The maracas too, but they offer less possibilities. At Max & Lea we opted for the",
